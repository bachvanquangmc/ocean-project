        ATitle: 'Things you can do about climate change',
        AText: 'As the world warms, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense, sea levels are rising, prolonged droughts are putting pressure on food crops, and many animal and plant species are being driven to extinction. It’s hard to imagine what we as individuals can do to resolve a problem of this scale and severity.    The good news: We are not alone. People, communities, cities, businesses, schools, faith groups and other organizations are taking action. We’re fighting like our lives depend on it — because they do.',
        Subtitle1: '1. Urge government to take bold, ambitious climate action now',
        Subtext1: 'Leading up to the next international climate conference in Glasgow in December 2021, Canada must act with urgency and ambition.  We now have a climate plan and accountability legislation, but neither is strong enough to meet our goals. Bold climate action is possible when we work together.',
        Subtitle2: '2. Use energy wisely — and save money too!',
        Subtext2: 'Canada is the top per-capita energy consumer in the world! By becoming more energy-efficient, you not only pollute less but save money too. A house with a furnace is like a car that idles all day. Swap your furnace for a heat pump, which works by extracting heat from one location and transferring it to another. Unplug computers, TVs and other electronics when you’re not using them. Change to energy-efficient light bulbs. etc. ',
        Subtitle3: '3. Green your commute',
        Subtext3: 'In Canada, transportation accounts for 24 per cent of climate-polluting emissions, a close second to the oil and gas industry.

Here are some exaples: Take public transit,Ride a bike or advocate for bike lanes in your community, Car-share, If you have a large, inefficient vehicle, retire it and switch to an electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle, Fly less (if you do fly, make sure you offset your emissions)',
        Subtitle4: '4. Consume less, waste less, enjoy life more',
        Subtext4: 'Focusing on life’s simple pleasures — spending time in nature, being with loved ones, making a difference to others — provides more purpose, belonging and happiness than buying and consuming. Plus, when we consume less, we produce fewer emissions and are gentler on the earth. Sharing, making, fixing, upcycling, repurposing and composting are all good places to start.',
        Subtitle5: '5. Invest in renewables and divest from fossil fuels',
        Subtext5: 'Even if you can’t install solar panels or a wind turbine, you can still be a part of the clean-energy economy. Search online for local renewable energy co-ops to join. As a member, you’ll own part of the co-op’s renewable energy projects and will receive a return on your investment. You can also speak to your financial adviser about clean energy/technology investments. Let industry know you care about climate change by meeting with your bank or investment adviser to make sure your investments do not include fossil fuels. And make sure your workplace, pension fund, university or bank doesn’t invest in fossil fuels either. If they do, join or start a divestment campaign.',
